  			<h2>Site Intent</h2>
  			<p>Fat Wreck Chords is a record label. It uses its website to promote records/bands,
  			   connect with fans, and sell merchandise. The goals of the end users would be to 
  			   buy merchandise, send in demos for consideration, find out tour dates and find 
  			   interesting info on their favorite bands. The current site design is highly cluttered 
  			   and difficult to navigate. The re-designed site needs to have a focus on simplicity, 
  			   while still maintaining the grunge/edgy/who-cares-what-you-think sense of style
  			   presently found in the site.</p>
