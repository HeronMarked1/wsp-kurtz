  			<h1>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h1>
  			<p class="question">Q. I’ve heard there’s some REALLY beautiful women and men that work at Fat Wreck Chords. 
  			How do I contact the label?</p>
  			<p class="answer">A. Make donations to the Beer Fund.
            <br>For general inquiries, email mailbag@fatwreck.com
            <br>For webstore inquiries, email mailorder@fatwreck.com and include your full name and order number from your 
            confirmation email. Aside from that, you can typically find us at any one of the bars or pubs in the San Francisco Bay Area. 
            With the obvious exceptions of Hemlock Tavern, Zeitgeist, Moby Dick’s, Kezar Pub, Mad Dog In The Fog, Yancy’s, and 
            Lucky 13. Duh.
            </p>
            <p class="question">Q. Do you guys take demos? How does our band get on Fat?
            </p>
            <p class="answer">A. Oh we get demos. TONS of them. Mike thinks it would be lame not to accept demos, but then again, he doesn’t have to 
            listen to the freakin’ things. If you must send us a demo, here is some advice: work on your songs, practice, and play 
            shows. It takes years of hard work to be a band that people care about, and once you’re there, labels will know about you. 
            Another thing, talent is not a requirement for Fat bands, but partying skills are.
            So yes, we accept demos. Send them all here:
            <br>Asian Man Records ATTN: Mike
            <br>PO Box 35585
            <br>Monte Soreno, CA 95030
            <br>You can also create an artist page and upload your demos there.
            </p>
            <p class="question">Q. Who owns Fat Wreck Chords? I hear that it’s a diabolical cabal that is headed up by Mr. Brett, Lee Iacocca, and Charro?
            </p>
            <p class="answer">A. Oooh, Charro. That would be nice. Fat Wreck Chords is an independently owned and operated record label founded by 
            Fat Mike and his wife Erin. They still own it and they both still run the place.
            </p>
            <p class="question">Q. Has Fat Mike ever put a paperclip in his computer because he thought the fan was making a “funny noise”, which in turn melted his 
            hard drive?
            </p>
            <p class="answer">Yes.
            </p>
            <p class="question">Q. What’s the biggest record on Fat?
            </p>
            <p class="answer">A. Some of our biggest records are: NOFX The War On Errorism, Me First and the Gimme Gimmes Have A Ball, the Rock 
            Against Bush comps, Lagwagon Hoss, Short Music For Short People, No Use For A Name Leche Con Carne, Hi-Standard 
            Angry Fist, and of course we’ve sold a boatload of the Fat Music comps. Contrary to the experts on the internet, Fat’s 
            never had any gold or platinum records.
