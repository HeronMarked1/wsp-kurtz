  		<h2>Web Standards Project, March 2013</h2>
  		<h3>Full Sail University</h3>

  				<li>Client: Fat Wreck Chords</li>

  			<h2>Site Intent</h2>
  			<p>Fat Wreck Chords is a record label. It uses its website to promote records/bands,
  			   connect with fans, and sell merchandise. The goals of the end users would be to 
  			   buy merchandise, send in demos for consideration, find out tour dates and find 
  			   interesting info on their favorite bands. The current site design is highly cluttered 
  			   and difficult to navigate. The re-designed site needs to have a focus on simplicity, 
  			   while still maintaining the grunge/edgy/who-cares-what-you-think sense of style
  			   presently found in the site.</p>
  		</div>
  		<div class="content_main">
  			<h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
  			<p>The FAQ on Fat Wreck Chords current site makes it clear that they have no interest
  			   in being a part of any large associations or organizations - apparently they prize
  			   their independence highly. Many of the competing small labels researched, such as ABB 
  			   Records, 2B1 Multimedia, and Absolutely Kosher feature web presences that are not well
  			   designed. ABB Records perhaps has the best site out of these, with a clean-cut and simple
  			   to use interface, as well as an easy way for aspiring artists to upload demo tracks. The
  			   drawback to their site is a main landing/portal page that has very little real content, 
  			   other than links to their store and to their dropbox for demo tracks - this will make it
  			   difficult for search engines to find them properly. The usability of their interface is
  			   one area where they definitely excelled above Fat Wreck Chords. Absolutely Kosher 
  			   Records' site presents an appealing color palette, whereas Fat Wreck Chords contains
  			   many poor color and contrast choices, making it difficult to look at and decipher. 
  			   None of these sites generates high traffic volume.</p>

  			<h2>Targeted Audience</h2>
  			<p>The current main demographic choosing to visit the Fat Wreck Chords site consists of 
  			   males between the ages of 18 and 34. The typical user will likely be someone who 
  			   identifies with the culture and unique personalities presented by the Fat Wreck Chords
  			   owners/operators. This user will also enjoy the local indie music scene and many will
  			   have an active nightlife, and will be visiting Fat Wreck Chords with the goal of 
  			   finding good music connections for enjoyment.</p>
  			<p>Another user could be an aspiring artist or band who wants to get signed by a record
  			   label. They might not necessarily care who signs them, so they will likely be shopping
  			   various labels' websites and submitting numerous demo tracks in an effort to get their
  			   music "out there."</p>
